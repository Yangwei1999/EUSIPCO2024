## Overview
The ESPRIT (Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques) method is widely used for signal processing applications, particularly in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. This repository aims to enhance the ESPRIT method by integrating random matrix theory to improve its performance and robustness.

## Methodology
Our approach leverages random matrix techniques to address some of the limitations of the traditional ESPRIT method, such as sensitivity to noise and limited data samples. Key improvements include:
- **Noise Reduction:** Utilizing random matrix theory to better separate signal and noise subspaces.
- **Robustness:** Enhancing the stability of parameter estimation under various conditions.
- **Efficiency:** Improving computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.
